# Getting Started with Create React App

As so often in life, things proceeded in an unexpected manner while developing this app. I wasn't able to complete the whole assignment within the timeframe, and resorted to the technology most familiar to me, which happens to be React. Most of the code is thus in this folder, not in the predefined folder I was supposed to use.

In order to run this app:

1. Run the backend and this project respectively with the command "npm start". The projects should be located in the same parent folder. 

2. The app works also only by running the frontend, but in order to see that the backend and frontend are connected, also the backend has to be run.
